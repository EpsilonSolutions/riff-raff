Concepts
========

Magenta and Riff-Raff configurations can be a little tricky to get right. This section tries to outline how Magenta
actually works under the hood and give some details on how it understands the files it reads.

The following concepts are discussed:

 - [How Magenta works](how-magenta-works.md)
 - [The terminology of Magenta](terminology.md)
 - [The anatomy of the artifacts.zip file](artifacts.zip.md)
 - [The anatomy of a deploy.json file](deploy.json.md)
