Magenta and Riff-Raff configurations can be a little tricky to get right. This section tries to outline how Magenta

The following concepts are discussed:

 - [How Magenta works](how-magenta-works)
 - [The terminology of Magenta](terminology)
 - [The anatomy of the artifacts.zip file](artifacts.zip)
 - [The anatomy of a deploy.json file](deploy.json)
