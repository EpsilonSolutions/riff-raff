If you want to get going quickly check out the [how-to section](./howto/).  In order to get a better understanding of
how a deploy works you should probably read through the [concepts](./concepts/). The documentation for each of the
available deployment types and their parameters is available on [this dynamically generated page](./types).

Finally, there are a couple of separate documents talking about the format of the [deployinfo file](deployinfo) and
the [CLI tool](commandline).
