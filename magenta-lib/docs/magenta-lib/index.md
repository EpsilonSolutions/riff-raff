If you want to get going quickly check out the [how-to section](./howto/) (although be warned that it may not be up to
date).

In order to get a better understanding of how a deploy works you should probably read through the
[concepts](./concepts/).

The documentation for each of the available deployment types and their parameters is available on [this dynamically
generated page](./types).

Finally, there are a couple of separate documents talking about the format of the [deployinfo file](deployinfo) and
the [CLI tool](commandline).
