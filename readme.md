"Deploy the transit beam"

About
-----

The Guardian's scala-based deployment library is designed to help automate
deploys by localising knowledge about how to orchestrate deploys within a
single system, but having defined interfaces with the applications and the
system on to which the deploys will happen.

Documentation
-----

The documentation has now been moved under [magenta-lib/docs](magenta-lib/docs) (for the main deployment library) and
[riff-raff/app/docs](riff-raff/app/docs) (for the web frontend).

What is still left to do?
